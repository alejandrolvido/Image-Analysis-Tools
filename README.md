# Image-Analysis-Tools

## Introduction
Built to create callable functions for usage in easily building, training, and testing CNNs.

## Installation
Download the PlugAndPlay script and place it in the folder with the CNN.

Then import with `from PlugAndPlay import *`.

## Customization
You can build your own function, as I have with `quickUsage()` to customize the script for your specific needs.
